_(CNN)_[EgyptAir][0]Flight 804 vanished off radar on its way from Paris to Cairo with 66 people aboard, an airline official said Thursday.

The plane was flying at 37,000 feet when it disappeared with 56 passengers and 10 crew members, the airline tweeted.

Dozens of somber family members gathered at the Cairo international airport, seeking word on their loved ones. Buses ferried them to a special hall, where doctors and translators awaited.

The Egyptian navy is conducting search and rescue operations with help from Greek authorities.
